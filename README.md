## This project isn't something serious.
I did it purely out of spontaneous desire. I'm going to release a couple of small updates, increasing the performance of the code and, in particular, fixing the ValueError exception that occurs when a frame takes too long to compute, but nothing more.
### Technically, this code should work with any video. Well. Theoretically.
